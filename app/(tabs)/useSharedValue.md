why we want something on both threads


ChatGPT said:
Excellent — this is a deep and very important question:

"Why do we want something (like a value) to exist on both the JS thread and the UI thread?"

Let’s get to the heart of it.

✅ Short Answer
Because the JS thread is slow and can get blocked, but the UI thread must stay fast and responsive.

By putting a value (like opacity, position, etc.) on both threads, we:

Let the UI thread update the screen directly

Let the JS thread control or initiate changes

Avoid waiting on JS to respond every frame

💡 Think of it Like This:
The UI thread is responsible for drawing.

The JS thread is responsible for logic (like what happens when a button is pressed).

If you want smooth animations, the UI thread must not wait for the JS thread.

But sometimes you need logic in JS to trigger or monitor the animation too. So the value must be shared — both can access it independently.

🧠 Real Example: Draggable Box
Imagine you’re dragging a box on the screen with your finger:

❌ If only the JS thread had access to the position:
Touch event → sent to JS thread

JS calculates new position

JS sends new position to native view

UI updates

If JS thread is slow, the box lags, because every move has to go through JS.

✅ If the position is a shared value:
Touch is handled on UI thread

UI thread directly updates position in real-time

No JS involvement per frame

No lag, even if JS is busy (e.g. logging, network calls)

📦 Why We Want Shared Values
Need	Why useSharedValue Helps
High-performance animations	UI thread animates without JS
Responsive gestures	Gesture handlers can update values in real time
Less latency	No need to bounce values through the bridge
Parallel work	UI and JS can access/update without waiting for each other

🔄 JS vs UI Thread Responsibilities
Task	Best Thread
User touch input	UI Thread
Drawing frames	UI Thread
Component logic (useEffect, state, etc.)	JS Thread
Updating animation frames	UI Thread
Telling animation when to start	JS Thread → UI Thread

So a shared value is the bridge — but without performance cost.

🧠 Analogy
Imagine a shared whiteboard (the shared value):

The JS thread writes: “start moving box to the right”

The UI thread reads from the whiteboard continuously: “okay, it’s now at position 100 → draw”

They don’t need to talk constantly — just read/write as needed

✅ Summary
We want something on both threads so that:

The UI thread can run animations smoothly and instantly

The JS thread can trigger, monitor, or read the animation

Both sides can work in parallel — no lag, no waiting

Without this, we either get:

❌ Laggy interactions (everything goes through JS)

❌ Less flexibility (animations that can't be driven by logic)

❌ Unnecessary complexity (custom bridges or event systems)

Would you like a visual diagram or gesture + animation example to make this crystal clear?





























okay so useState creates variable which is accessible i js thread but useShared Vlaue created variable accessible to both threads


ChatGPT said:
✅ Exactly — that's spot on. Here's the precise version of what you just said:

🔄 useState vs useSharedValue
Hook	Value is stored on	Accessible by	React Re-render Triggered?	Good for
useState	JS thread	Only JS thread	✅ Yes	Logic, UI state (form inputs, counters)
useSharedValue	Shared memory (JS + UI thread)	✅ Both threads (via JSI)	❌ No	Animations, gestures, frame-by-frame updates

🧠 Breakdown
🟡 useState
tsx
Copy
Edit
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
Lives only on the JS thread

Reactively triggers a re-render when updated

Good for business logic or UI state, but too slow for per-frame animations

🟢 useSharedValue
tsx
Copy
Edit
const position = useSharedValue(0);
Stored in a shared native memory buffer

Accessible directly on the UI thread (via worklets) and JS thread

Can be animated with withTiming, withSpring, etc.

Does not cause re-renders, but is very efficient for high-frequency updates

📌 In Plain Words:
Concept	What it Means
useState	You’re storing a value in JS memory, and React watches it to re-render components.
useSharedValue	You’re storing a value in shared memory so both UI and JS can read/write it independently, without triggering re-renders.

Would you like an animation example (e.g. bouncing ball or drag box) where I explain how useSharedValue keeps the UI smooth even if JS is frozen?
