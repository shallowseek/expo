ChatGPT said:
To center the rectangle in the frame when using useSkiaFrameProcessor, you need to calculate the top-left corner of the rectangle such that it's centered within the frame dimensions.

Currently, you're setting the top-left corner at (centerX + 10, centerY + 10), which offsets it to the bottom right ‚Äî not centered.

‚úÖ Fix: Subtract half of the rectangle size from the center
Here‚Äôs the corrected code:

  const frameWidth = frame.width
  const frameHeight = frame.height
  console.log(`this is the frame width x height ${frameWidth}x${frameHeight}`)

  frame.render()

  // Calculate center
  const centerX = frameWidth / 2
  const centerY = frameHeight / 2

  const rectWidth = 150
  const rectHeight = 150

  // Calculate top-left corner to center the rectangle
  const topLeftX = centerX - rectWidth / 2
  const topLeftY = centerY - rectHeight / 2

  const rect = Skia.XYWHRect(topLeftX, topLeftY, rectWidth, rectHeight)
  const paint = Skia.Paint()
  paint.setStyle(PaintStyle.Stroke)
  paint.setColor(Skia.Color('red'))
  paint.setStrokeWidth(4)

  frame.drawRect(rect, paint)

‚úÖ Summary of changes
Subtracted rectWidth / 2 and rectHeight / 2 from centerX and centerY

This ensures the rectangle is centered instead of offset

Great question! Let's visually and mathematically understand how to center a rectangle in a frame.

üß† You‚Äôre trying to draw a rectangle:
Inside a 2D frame (like a photo or camera view)

The frame has a certain width and height

You want the rectangle to be centered

üéØ Goal:
Place the rectangle so its center aligns with the center of the frame.

‚úçÔ∏è Example:
Let‚Äôs say:

Frame size = width: 400, height: 300

Rectangle size = width: 150, height: 150

üìê Frame center:
To get the center of the frame:

ini
Copy
Edit
centerX = frameWidth / 2 = 400 / 2 = 200
centerY = frameHeight / 2 = 300 / 2 = 150
This is the point in the middle of the frame.

üü• Now, to center the rectangle:
If you start drawing the rectangle from (200, 150), it will start at the center, which is wrong ‚Äî because it will go down and to the right of center.

What you actually want is the rectangle's center to be at (200, 150)

So you have to move backward by half the rectangle‚Äôs size.

ini
Copy
Edit
rectTopLeftX = centerX - rectWidth / 2 = 200 - 75 = 125
rectTopLeftY = centerY - rectHeight / 2 = 150 - 75 = 75
